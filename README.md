# LBANN: Livermore Big Artificial Neural Network Toolkit

The Livermore Big Artificial Neural Network toolkit (LBANN) is an
open-source, HPC-centric, deep learning training framework that is
optimized to compose multiple levels of parallelism.

LBANN provides model-parallel acceleration through domain
decomposition to optimize for strong scaling of network training.  It
also allows for composition of model-parallelism with both data
parallelism and ensemble training methods for training large neural
networks with massive amounts of data.  LBANN is able to advantage of
tightly-coupled accelerators, low-latency high-bandwidth networking,
and high-bandwidth parallel file systems.

##  DGraph
DGraph is deep learning library for training graph neural networks at scale that is built on top of PyTorch.


To install DGraph, clone the repository and install with pip:
```shell
pip install -e .[ogb]
```

### Running tests
To run the tests, use the following command:
```shell
python -m pytest tests/
```

### Requirements
DGraph requires the following packages:
- PyTorch >= 2.1.0
- NumPy
- pytest
- mpi4py

For the full list of requirements, see `requirements.txt`.

DGraph also requires the following libraries:
- NCCL
- NVSHMEM

DGraph supports three communication backends: `nccl`, `mpi`, and two NVSHMEM-based
backends, `nvshmem` (a custom pybind11/CUDA extension, built via CMake) and
`nvshmem4py` (NVIDIA's official pip-installable NVSHMEM Python bindings, installed
via `pip install -e '.[nvshmem4py]'`). Prefer `nvshmem4py` for quicker iteration
without a CUDA rebuild; prefer `nvshmem` for the fused-kernel gather/scatter path,
which is currently faster since `nvshmem4py` dispatches host-side put/get per index.
